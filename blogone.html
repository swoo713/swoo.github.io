    <p>Social media creates platforms for people to express, embrace and share stories. Such platforms such as twitter, facebook, Instagram and snap chat can easily spread ideas and cause millennials to make a difference around the globe. The #metoo
      campaign started with Tarana Burke in 2006, who used the term “me too” to help women who suffered through sexual violence. The term has recently been renewed in the past ten years as a way for people to share their stories of sexual violence
      through social media. In 2017, Ashley Judd accused Harvey Weinstein of assaulting her in an article with The New York Times. Then actress Alyssa Milano tweeted “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this
      tweet.”, this tweet got tens of thousands of replies of women either encouraging others to do so or detailing their personal experiences with sexual assault. Since the detailed investigation against Harvey Weinstein was released to the public,
      social media became the main outlet for discussion. The hashtag has taken the world by storm causing a huge social presence bringing many high officials accountable for their past misconduct. Not only does this hashtag hold men accountable,
      but empowers women to speak up and show that what they have to say matters. This is a major step forward for the feminist movement because this marks where women can be just as powerful and strong. That there are millions of survivors battling
      with their experiences of sexual assault. This social media gives credit to women for being honest and speaking up, that when they speak up, people will believe and support them. The “me too” social media campaign is credited for being a
      powerful step in contributing towards the feminist movement and aiding in women’s rights. The social media campaign has gained a lot of attention and eventually launched the project the Time’s Up Legal Defence Fund. This fund has been given
      donations totaling $21 million dollars made by actresses, writers and directors. The fund prioritizes cases with low-wage workers, women in non-traditional jobs, people of colour, LGBTQ people, and people facing legal retaliation because they
      spoke out. The fund has also helped men who have suffered through sexial violence. “Me Too” has helped men come forward with their experiences.
