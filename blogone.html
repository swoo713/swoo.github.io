      <p>Social media creates platforms for people to express, embrace and share stories. Such platforms such as twitter, facebook, Instagram and snap chat can easily spread ideas and cause millennials to make a difference around the globe. The #metoo movement started with Tarana Burke in 2006, who used the term “me too” to help women who suffered through sexual violence. The term has recently been renewed in the past ten years as a way for people to share their stories of sexual violence through social media. In 2017, Ashley Judd accused Harvey Weinstein of assaulting her in an article with The New York Times. Then actress Alyssa Milano tweeted “If you’ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write ‘me too’ as a reply to this tweet.”, this tweet got tens of thousands of replies of women either encouraging others to do so or detailing their personal experiences with sexual assault. Since the detailed investigation against Harvey Weinstein was released to the public, social media became the main outlet for discussion. The hashtag has taken the world by storm causing a huge social movement, bringing many high officials accountable for their past misconduct. Not only does this hashtag hold men accountable, but empowers women to speak up and show that what they have to say matters. This is a major step forward for the feminist movement because this marks where women can be just as powerful and strong. That there are millions of survivors battling with their experiences of sexual assault. This movement gives credit to women for being honest and speaking up, that when they speak up, people will believe and support them.
