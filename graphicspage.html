        <p><b>Challenge:</b> The UC Davis Mental Health Initiative wanted me to create a social media graphic that would be fun and catch the eye of students as they pass it on campus or online.</p>
        <p><b>Solution:</b> I decided to use watercolor as the main texture and look of my design because I think it is easy on the eyes and will create a sense of tranquility, warmth and safety that I want our audience to feel. </p>

        <p><b>Challenge:</b> For my work, there needed to be a graphic to tell bus riders about spare the air days and there would no longer be free rides. </p>
        <p><b> Solution:</b> I chose a lightblue as the background for the flyer to represent the clean air and a bright color to catch the eyes of bus riders, then I added clouds, planes with banners to represent the announcement.
          The used a bold black sans serif font to make the heading and message clear and ledgible.</p>

        <p><b>Challenge:</b> For the UC Davis Zero Waste and Sustainability Club, the Co-Graphic Designer and I wanted to create a simple logo that is versatile, it would be able to easy go on anything from a shirt to a table banner.</p>
        <p><b> Solution:</b> For the design, our main color scheme was green to represent the environment, a mason jar to symbolize reuseability, and a succulent to show life, prosperity and living plants.</p>

      <article><img src="summerflyer.jpg" alt="portfoliopic" />
        <p><b>Challenge:</b> Before finals week of Spring 2018, my work wanted me to create a fun, summer vibes flyer and poster to let students know when summer service would begin. </p>
        <p><b> Solution:</b> I wanted to incorporate bright and pops of colors to bring light and "fun in the sun" vibes, and since popsicles are so delicious to eat in the summer I wanted that to be the center of my design. The aesthetic I was
          going for was a pool party with the inner tubes, sun glasses, melting popsicles and a nice day at the pool. </p>

      <article><img src="edcposter.jpg" alt="portfoliopic" />
        <p><b>Challenge:</b> The goal was this project was to make a poster of an event that illuminates the experience of the event. For this design, it is key to do research on the actual event to help conceptualize your poster. Using both Adobe
          Illustrator
          and Adobe Photoshop you must include what the poster is for, where it takes place and when it is occuring. The design should appeal towards the target audience even those that may not even know of this event. </p>
        <p><b> Solution:</b> For my event, I picked the Electric Daisy Carnival because it has always been a dream of mine to go to this 3 day electronic dance music festival. This festival is targeted towards those 18 years and older. The
          experience is suppose to be eccentric and full of different stages for a variety of huge EDM artists shooting out different lights to match with the beats. The carnival rides and performers are suppose to add to the circus like experience.
          I found an image of one of the ferris wheels with bright fireworks exploding behind it to show audience all the wild fun they could see. I found it important to incorporate this year’s “All are welcomed here” symbol by placing it below the
          ferris wheel to blend in as
          its bottom. I carefully curved each artist’s name around the wheel lining up with the spokes and took colors from the fireworks and EDC symbol to unify the text with the poster as a whole. I wanted young audiences to keep in mind the
          location and year as well as the event so I made those the largest texts on the poster. The orginial font used in the EDC 2018 ads used Futura bold, hence
          I used the same typeface for my design. I also burned the image where the
          font was ledgible enough.</p>

        <p><b>Challenge:</b> The purpose of this project was to draw a costume design on a proportional figure. Then, after the figure is drawn you have to apply the four color variations: complementary, triadic, analogous and monochromatic. The
          colors could be chosen useing Adobe Kuler, which helps artists chose from a variety of color schemes. Once the colors and figure is done, then it can be drawn digitally in Adobe Illustrator. The different shades and tints of the color
          schemes helps add depth and dimension to the figure.</p>
        <p><b> Solution:</b> For my design, I chose to do a hip, retro longsleeve shift dress with boots that resemble timberland boots. Accessorized with a simplistic necklace and circular sunglasses. When I sketched my figure,
          I got inspiration from candid model shots on different websites in order to make sure the leg and body position was accurate. I added shapes and adjusted the colors and opacity to add depth to her clothes and body. My method for choosing
          colors was to find ones that were eccentric that would help her stand out to people’s eyes.</p>

      <article><img src="MLKposter.jpg" alt="portfoliopic" />
        <p><b>Challenge:</b> The intent for this design was to use Adobe Photoshop to create a poster of a leader within arts or sciences that is no longer alive. The design should honor the person’s life and the strong influences they had on the
          world. It was essential to incorporate two high quality photos that would best portray the leader’s achievements and their name. The poster should have colors that help blend images together to make the poster look as a whole. Photoshop
          has a variety of blending, layering and adjustment tools to use in order to make your design come together. </p>
        <p><b> Solution:</b> For my leader, I chose Martin Luther King Jr. because he was such a huge part of the Civil Right’s Movement who embraced non-violence
          and giving black minorities equal rights. The first image I chose was captured from the 1963 March of Washington, where MLK Jr. marched with 250,000 people to the capital and gave his legendary “I have a dream..” speech. The second image
          on the bottom was from the same event, but truly shows his
          strong leadership to the movement and that his powerful words reached so many people, as he stands amongst thousands. I used the Futura font because
          it is a popular font to use for protests due to its ledgibility and boldness. The burn tool helped me make the white font stand out on top of the black and
          white images, without me having to just draw an opaque black rectangle
          behind the letters.</p>

        <p><b>Challenge:</b>The objective of this project was to select a well-known typeface and create a poster that would present the fundamental aspects of the letterforms. Each typeface has its own unique characteristics. It was crucial to
          incorporate the typeface’s name, designer, all the upper and lower case letters, a set of numbers and the date it was issued. The challenge was to only use letters and colors to unify your poster in order to show how the typefce was
          orginally used and how its currently used in the modern world. </p>
        <p><b> Solution:</b> I choose the typeface Frutiger because of its modern appeal. The typeface was originially created for an airport in France in order to make wayfinding easy for travelers. I decided to use a black background and bright
          lettering because it is a common theme in airport signage. Then, I got inspired by photos of real life airport signs and used those to create my own version to convey the
          how Frutiger is important in wayfinding within many famous airports and show that it is easily ledgible.<p>
