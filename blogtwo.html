    <p>Another part of how “Me Too” can change the world is spreading the conversation of how to improve work environments, now that society is more conscious about sexual harassment and assault. Ted Bunch, Co-founder of social activism group “A
      Call to Men”, teaches men ways to be allies and healthy ways of “being a man”. There needs to be less tolerance for sexist jokes and viewing women as objects. The media is filled with people who think their “harmless” jokes do not validate the
      sexist and dangerous behavior that occurs. To push the campaign beyond social media, there need to be initiatives to lay the law down on training to teach people about healthy work environments and behavior. This will help lessen the gray
      areas of inappropriate interactions with co-workers. If a person does act inappropriately, then there should be policies that protect the person that came forward as well as proper repercussions to the assaulter. According to a Time’s article,
      many women feel forced to leave their jobs due to issues of harassment at work or refused promotions, which in turn affects the gender wage gap. Situations become so dire that women leave to go to a lower paying or less demanding jobs.
      Corporations have an instinct to protect their reputation, instead of setting a good example and showing victims that it is the right choice to speak up. Recently, Google was under controversy for paying millions of dollars in severance
      packages to male executives accused of sexual assault to keep quiet about their offenses. Even after accusations were proven credible, Google still proceeded to pay off these workers. This raises the questions of how respected are women in
      workplace culture and large industries? Tech and engineering are extremely male-dominated and by paying off those who have taken advantage of their power, its nothing less than a slap on the wrist. Google has proven that society undervalues
      and mistreats women. Although “Me Too” has been able to spread the word over social media in different parts of the globe, there are still lots of improvements that our society needs in the real world. There need to be companies taking action
      to stop workplace sexual harassment and build an environment where women feel valued enough to speak up and not forced out of where they have worked so hard to be.
