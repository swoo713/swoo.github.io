      <h3>Story Ending One</h3>
      <p>My dog entered the door of our house. He sat looking older and dirtier. Our family was shocked to see that he had with him what appeared to be another odd looking dog. The other dog was green and hairless with its eyes hanging off of
        atennas above its head. The alien dog was also glowing green. With hesitation, both dogs decided to enter the house. As my dog started getting more comfortable, the alien dog began floating around the house sniffing every little corner. My
        dog just
        stood idlely by and observed. My family started screaming in shock, attempting to get the alien dog off of the ceiling. I tried giving my dog and the alien dog a treat and they both gently took it out of my hands. I found the alien dog to be
        respectful and friendly and convinced my family to take it in as our own. Now we had 2 dogs.

      <h3>Story Ending Two</h3>
      <p>My dog knocked on the front door and when my family opened it we were in shock. He was unrecognizable with purple hair, a shiny neon blue cape and glowing pink eyes. We were hesitant to let him in the house, but knew he would not do
        anything dangerous. Once he got in the house, he ran to the kitchen and opened his mouth, vaccumming all the food into it. It seemed out of this world. He then flew out the window into the night sky and left us a note in our kitchen. The
        note said "your donation of food is very much appreciated from the planet of dorbz, sorry for the inconvinience"
