        <p>Montserrat has 3 font families. These varieties are regular, alternate caps and "Subrayada"
        (an underlined version). The regular Montserrat is the most known for its geometric
        style letters. It has a modernist style of the early 1900s and its designer, Julieta Ulanovsky,
        was largely inspired by poster and signs around the traditional Montserrat neighborhood in
        Buenos Aires. This typeface embodies the urban typography that arose in the first half of the 20th century.
        She intended for Montserrat to keep cities beautiful as urban developments change throughout time.Today,
        Montserrat is best used for digital web design as large headers or in combination with a serif font
        in the body text, advertisements, blog and portofolios. This font has great ledgibility and form which makes it easy to use for almost any type of modern design.</p>

      <h2 style="color:Aquamarine">Usage</h2>
        <p>Montserrat is san serif font often used as a header/title text on websites. The
      overall design of the typeface is very modern but not super uniform in style, which
      makes it ideal for more commercial companies looking to create a web page that has
      a more casual aesthetic. Some examples include the websites dangblast.com and
      hansonwu.com, which both use the font for the main headings, while having another
      serif font for the body text. Both sites use Montserrat pretty effectively, for the
      boldness of the font attracts the eye of the viewer to the information contained
      within the body text.</p>
